Graded Readers are awesome, but how about graded verses?

The aim of this code is the rank the difficult of all Greek New Testament verses for the student that has finished 1 year of Koine Greek.

The "difficulty" of each verse is measure by the sum of the occurrence of each word in the New Testament divided by the total number of words in the verse.

There is a frequency of each word of the New Testament in the code, feel free to use it.

The top verse should be the easiest verse in the entire New Testament(according my metrics of measurement).
